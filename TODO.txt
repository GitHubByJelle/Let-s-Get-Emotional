What to do?

1) Make models in nets.py and try them out (On balanced dataset).
    1.1) When are models performing good? What's the effect of kernel size, max pooling, batchnormalization, etc.
    1.2) Calculate performance meaures
    1.3) Make visualisations of intresting models
2) Choose best model
    2.1) Fine tune parameters
    2.2) Try out different transformations / loaders
    2.3) Train model until is doesn't improve anymore (performance measures)
    2.4) Compare models with SqueezeNet
3) Analyse best model
    3.1) Visualise convolution layers (filter and effect)
    3.2) Visualise important areas
    3.3) Visualise activations
